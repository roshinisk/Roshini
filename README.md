## ASSIGNMENT

## *Technology I would like to learn :*
I am deeply interested in learning Artificial Intelligence which deals with developing theories, methods, technologies, and application systems which simulates the extension and expansion of human intelligence.The use of artificial intelligence research is to make sure that machines can perform some complex tasks that require intelligent humans to complete. It make use of a wellknown algorithm,Neural Networks. AI would also have a low error rate and have incredible precision, accuracy, and speed.

I would also be happy to learn Microsoft Azure which is the fastest growing and second largest cloud computing platform. An important aspect is that cloud computing provides access to computing resources over the internet and the users can access any service based on their requirement. I strongly believe that it have a lot more to do in the near future.
