## ASSIGNMENT

## *Technology I would like to learn :*
I am deeply interested in learning Artificial Intelligence which deals with developing theories, methods, technologies, and application systems which simulates the extension and expansion of human intelligence.The use of artificial intelligence research is to make sure that machines can perform some complex tasks that require intelligent humans to complete. It makes use of Neural Networks.AI would also have a low error rate and have incredible precision, accuracy, and speed.

I would also be happy to learn Microsoft Azure which is the fastest growing and second largest cloud computing platform.
